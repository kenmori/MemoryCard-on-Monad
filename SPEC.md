# Memory Match Game Specification

## 1. Overview
This is a casual memory card matching game with a leveling and point system. Players flip cards to find matching pairs under a countdown timer. As levels progress, the number of cards increases and the memorization time decreases, making the challenge harder.

## 2. Game Flow
1. **Start Screen**
   - Player sees a "Start Game" button with the primary color theme (#836ef9).
   - Game instructions displayed below the title
   - Wallet connection interface  

2. **Level Setup**  
   - Level 1 starts with 6 cards (3 pairs).  
   - At certain levels, the number of cards increases.

3. **Memorization Phase**  
   - All cards are shown face up for **5 seconds**.  
   - A countdown timer is displayed.  
   - After the countdown ends, the cards flip face down.  

4. **Play Phase**  
   - Player flips two cards at a time.  
   - If the pair matches, "NiceðŸ’œ" or "GMonadðŸ’œ" (rare) appears from the bottom-right with white background.  
   - If not, they flip back after a short delay.  

5. **Scoring System**  
   - Each successful match awards **+100 points**.  
   - Bonus points for completing levels quickly.

   - "NiceðŸ’œ" or "GMonadðŸ’œ" (20% chance) slides up from bottom-right in white bubble
   - "CongratulationsðŸ¥³" when all pairs are matched
   - Smooth card flip animations
   - Visual feedback for all interactions

8. **Level Progression**  
   - Once all pairs are found, the player advances to the next level.  
   - Higher levels introduce more cards.

## 3. Design Guidelines
- Primary color: **#836ef9**  
- Secondary colors should harmonize with the primary theme (soft gradients, complementary neutrals).  
- Layout should be minimal, playful, and responsive.  
- Timer and score must be clearly visible during gameplay.
- **All text in English**
