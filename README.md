## üéØ Game Features

- **Memory Challenge**: Memorize card positions and match pairs
- **Progressive Difficulty**: 16+ levels with increasing complexity
- **Scoring System**: Earn points based on attempt efficiency
- **Blockchain Integration**: Save progress on-chain with 0.01 MON
- **Wallet Support**: Connect with RainbowKit integration
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- npm or yarn
- A Monad testnet wallet with MON tokens

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd monad-tx-game
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Copy environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Configure your environment variables in `.env`:
```bash
# Smart Contract Address (will be set after deployment)
VITE_MEMORY_GAME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# WalletConnect Project ID (get from https://cloud.walletconnect.com)
VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here

# Private key for deployment (for development only)
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Running Locally

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Smart Contract Development

Compile contracts:
```bash
npm run compile
```

Run tests:
```bash
npm run test
```

Start local Hardhat network:
```bash
npm run node
```

Deploy to local network:
```bash
npm run deploy:localhost
```

### Deploying to Monad Testnet

1. Make sure you have MON tokens for gas fees
2. Update your `.env` with your private key
3. Deploy the contract:
```bash
npm run deploy:monad
```

4. Update `VITE_MEMORY_GAME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with the deployed address
5. Restart your development server

## üåê Production Deployment

### Building for Production

Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

### Deploying to Vercel

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set up environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `VITE_MEMORY_GAME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
   - `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`
3. Deploy automatically on push to main branch

Or deploy directly:
```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Connect Wallet**: Use RainbowKit to connect your Monad testnet wallet
2. **Start Game**: Click "Start Game" to begin
3. **Memorize**: Watch cards flip over during countdown
4. **Match Pairs**: Click cards to find matching pairs
5. **Score Points**: Earn more points for fewer attempts
6. **Save Progress**: Pay 0.01 MON to save your progress on-chain
7. **Level Up**: Complete all pairs to advance to the next level

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contract (`MemoryGame.sol`)
- Player registration and level management
- Score tracking and leaderboards
- Progress saving with 0.01 MON payment
- Event emissions for frontend integration

### Frontend (React + Vite)
- Game logic and UI components
- Blockchain integration with wagmi/viem
- RainbowKit wallet connection
- Responsive design with CSS animations

### Key Components
- `App.jsx` - Main application state and routing
- `MemoryGame.jsx` - Core game logic and UI
- `SaveProgressModal.jsx` - Blockchain progress saving
- `useMemoryGameContract.js` - Smart contract integration hook

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Contract not found error**:
- Ensure `VITE_MEMORY_GAME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` is set correctly
- Verify the contract is deployed to the correct network

**Wallet connection issues**:
- Check that you're connected to Monad testnet
- Ensure you have MON tokens for transactions
- Verify `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` is configured

**Build errors**:
- Clear cache: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`
- Check Node.js version (18+ required)
